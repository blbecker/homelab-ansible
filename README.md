# Homelab-FLux / Ansible

This is the ansible automation to manage the lower-level configuration of the kubernetes cluster and the hosts that participate in it. Mostly setting up monitoring and things on the underlying box. All of the "interesting" parts of my homelab are in k8s so the ansible side of things stays rather clean.
